The homework 
Western blotting was used to monitor the protein expression in callus tissue. Three RBD positive plants with good growth were randomly selected from each of the two promoter groups and cultured for maturity. And use PCR to monitor whether all mature plants contain the target gene.

Take some fresh callus tissue, crush it, and use protein blotting to monitor RBD content. Transfer rice callus that can detect RBD to differentiation medium. Wait for the callus to differentiate into different organ primordia, form embryoids, and finally develop into renewable shoots. Reduce the concentration of cytokinins and increase the concentration of auxin, and wait for them to develop roots before transplanting to experimental fields or release environments.
