The homework 
Western blotting was used to monitor the protein expression in callus tissue. Three RBD positive plants with good growth were randomly selected from each of the two promoter groups and cultured for maturity. And use PCR to monitor whether all mature plants contain the target gene.

Take some fresh callus tissue, crush it, and use protein blotting to monitor RBD content. Transfer rice callus that can detect RBD to differentiation medium. Wait for the callus to differentiate into different organ primordia, form embryoids, and finally develop into renewable shoots. Reduce the concentration of cytokinins and increase the concentration of auxin, and wait for them to develop roots before transplanting to experimental fields or release environments.


Considering that the binding of antibody detection with human ACE only has specificity for some protein domains, we introduced two other methods in this experiment, Western dot matrix method and PCR. These two methods can help us screen RBD positive plants on the one hand, and also determine that the protein expressed in the plants is RBD. The Western dot matrix method can determine the molecular weight of proteins by the movement speed of protein bands. Here, we use ACE2 as a capture reagent to purify RBD proteins. Several bands can be designed, including 65 positive plant callus bands of the same fresh weight, RBD protein positive control bands, and maker bands. PCR is a sequencing method that can determine whether the plant has transferred to the RBD protein gene.

Process the target monitoring tissues of different plants to obtain protein solutions. Purification of RBD protein using human ACE2 protein specific affinity chromatography.
