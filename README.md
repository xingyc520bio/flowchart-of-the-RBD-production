The seed yield of the same pUbi-RBD plants varies greatly, and it is necessary to expand the planting scale to ensure yield during application. Moreover, only the yield of T1 seeds was verified in the experiment, and if the RBD yield has genetic stability, it can greatly increase the value of this scheme. These are all experimental directions that can be considered in the future.
